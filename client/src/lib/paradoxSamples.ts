    content: "People who are the bottom of a hierarchy are far less likely to spurn that hierarchy than they are to use it against people who are trying to climb the ranks of that hierarchy. The person who never graduates from college may in some contexts claim that a college degree is worthless, but he is unlikely to act accordingly. When he comes across someone without a college degree who is trying to make something of himself, he is likely to pounce on that person, claiming he is an uncredentialed fraud. Explanation: Losers want others to share their coffin, and if that involves hyper-valuing the very people or institutions that put them in that coffin, then so be it.",

    content: "People don't give good reviews to writers who do not already have positive reviews. Analysis: This is a veridical paradox, in the sense that it describes an actual vicious circle and does not represent a logical blunder. An independent writer is by definition one who does not have a marketing apparatus behind him, and such a writer depends on uncoerced positive reviews. But people are extremely reluctant to give good reviews to writers who are not popular already or who do not have the weight of some institution behind them. This circle can be broken by writers who mass-produce schlock, but there is no real way for other writers to break it. This is a special form of the Grass Roots Movement Paradox.",

But information is bought. Solution: The obvious solution is that information can be described without being disclosed. I can tell you that I have the so and so's phone number without giving you that number, and the circumstances may give you reason to believe me. But oftentimes it isn't until a given person discloses what he says he knows that he there is any reason to believe him to know it.

But such an ass would in fact be able to make a decision. Explanation: This isn't exactly a paradox. There is nothing absurd in the supposition that a creature in such a situation might simply 'halt', and we don't know that actual biological creatures would not in fact halt in such a situation, since it seldom if ever happens that a creature is confronted with options that are exactly equally appealing.",

Solution: There is a difference between intelligence and rationality. Intelligence answers the question: What is it objectively possible to do? Rationality answers the question: What do my limited resources of time, energy and intelligence make it incumbent on me to do? And the second answer breaks any deadlocks created by the first.",

    content: "Any given course of conduct complies with many different rules, and there is therefore no good reason to say of a given act that it is an act of following this as opposed to that rule. So any putative case of following a given rule might equally reasonably be seen as a case of following some other, incompatible rule, and there is therefore no good reason to regard any act as a case of following any given rule. The solution: Taken in isolation, a given action can be interpreted as an act of compliance with any given one of a plurality of incompatible rules. If you say \"4\" when I ask you \"what is 2+2?\", I cannot on the basis alone rule out the possibility that you took \"what is 2+2?\" and \"4\" to mean, respectively, \"I want to play chess\" and \"I do not have time for childish pastimes.\" But if that is what you meant, there will be independent evidence for it, meaning that there will be some reason independently of this context to believe that you take those words to have those meanings.",

Explanation: In the US, when money is poured into education, it is not to improve education but is rather to provide incompetent people with fake employment as educational administrators or teachers. So with each new wave of educational funding, a bloated, entrenched and incompetent cadre of educational bureaucrats becomes even more bloated, entrenched and incompetent, with predictably adverse effects on student-learning. In the US, when money is poured into public schools, it isn't about improving education. It is about creating straw government jobs at the expense of real private sector jobs.",

But if you have money you won't work for Primerica, because there is no reason to do so. And yet people work for Primerica. Explanation: Primerica is a multi-level insurance company. Its representatives have to pay to work there. They do not make a salary and only make money off of commissions. But they don't make money off of commissions since they almost never make sales, and they don't make sales because nobody wants Primerica insurance since it's bad and definitely don't want to buy it from some sleazy Primerica sales representative.",

The argument: Let h be a term referring to a such a natural number such that h is synonymous with 'the reference of h+1', and let n be the referent of h. Since h is synonymous with, and therefore has the same referent as 'the referent of h+1', it follows that the referent of h is n+1. And since n is by hypothesis the referent of h, it follows that n+n+1. Analysis: If h is synonymous with 'the referent of h+1', then h is defined in terms of an expression that is itself defined in terms of h and h consequently has no referent. So h doesn't refer to any number and a fortiori doesn't refer to the successor of any number.",

It is if it isn't and if isn't if it is. Solution: To say that 'polysyllabic' is true of itself is to say that 'polysyllabic' is polysyllabic. To say that 'is an English expression' is true of itself is to say that 'is an English expression' is an English expression. 'True of itself,' when meaningful, simply abbreviates some non-reflexive construction; and when it doesn't do so, the term 'self' an undefined pronoun—a free variable, in other words."

Analysis: Three grains of sand is more of a heap than two; four are more of a heap than three. n+1 grains of sand are more 'heapy' than n grains. If, for arbitrary n, n grains of sand qualify as a heap, they do so because they are heapy enough relative to some benchmark. They may be heapy enough to alter the path of a rolling golf ball or they may be heapy enough to block traffic. There are infinitely many different Sorites paradoxes and they are all to be solved in more or less the same way."

    content: "There are non-denumerably many regions R that a given coin dropped on a flat surface can occupy after settling. So if R* is the exact region that the coin does occupy, the chances of the coin's occupying that exact region are 1 divided by the number of such regions and are therefore zero. But since the coin does occupy R*, the chances of its doing so are greater than zero. The solution: If an infinitely large class contains zero x's, then the chances of choosing an x from that class are nil. If an infinitely large class contains one x, then the chances of choosing an x from that class are infinitesimally small but not nil."

According to G.E. Moore, there is a 'paradox of analysis,' for the reason that if a conceptual analysis is true, then both sides of the 'if and only if' say the same thing, in which case said analysis is uninformative. The solution is that the information-load borne by a statement is a function not only of what it says but how it says it."

    content: "If an institution exists to solve some problem, then it has an incentive to prevent that problem from being solved, since there will be no demand for that institution. So creating institutions to solve problems may prevent those problems from being solved. For example, philosophy departments supposedly exist to solve philosophical problems (or teach people how to solve them). But as anyone who has been in such a department knows, on the rare occasions that somebody comes along who actually has a solution, or even a fragment thereof, he is mercilessly attacked. The answer seems to be this. If an institution stands to gain money by solving the problem that it is supposed to solve, then it will try to do so; and it stands to lose money by doing so, it will prevent it from it being solved."

    content: "An author presumably believes each of the assertions in a book that he writes. But many books contain forward by the author in which he says that there are inevitably many false statements in the pages to come. How is this paradox to be solved? It is solved by pointing that the key premise is false: an author usually doesn't believe everything that he writes in a given book. A book is not just a list of assertions. A book consists of assertions supported by arguments. Much of what an author writes he writes not because he believes that it is true but because he believes that, the data being what it is, it must be true."

This paradox is based on a fallacy. Let S be the statement: 'some things cannot be described.' There is no particular object x such that S says of x that x cannot be described. S makes a statement about a class of objects. It says that the class of indescribable objects is non-empty. There is no particular member of that class to which it ascribes the property of being indescribable. So there is no particular object to which S ascribes any property, and S therefore doesn't self-refute."

    content: "Consider a barber who shaves all and only those who do not shave themselves. Does that barber shave himself? If he does, then he doesn't; and if he doesn't, then he does. Conclusion: Such a barber cannot exist. That is what this paradox shows. Now consider the set of all sets that don't contain themselves. If that set contains itself, then it doesn't, and if doesn't, then it does. Therefore, such a set cannot exist. Bertrand Russell believed this to prove the falsity of the so-called Axiom of Comprehension, this being the principle that any given property generates a set."

    content: "On Sunday, judge condemns Smith to be hanged some day the subsequent week on or before Friday, with the qualification that the day of the hanging will be a surprise to Smith. Smith deduces that he will not be hanged, his reasoning being as follows. He cannot be hanged on Friday, since, if he makes it to Friday, it won't be a surprise to him that he is to hanged on that day. Nor therefore can be hanged on Thursday, since Friday has already been ruled out and since, if he makes it to Thursday, a Thursday-hanging won't be a surprise to him. The solution to this paradox lies in the fact that 'surprise' is a relative term: what is a surprise to one person may not be a surprise to another; and what is a surprise to a person at one time may not be a surprise to him at a later time."

But if I order you to clean your room, you are not complying if you either clean your room or burn down the house. Where 'imperatival logic' is concerned, the strong appears not to entail the weak. This asymmetry between alethic and imperatival logic is known as Ross's Paradox. Why this asymmetry? Because whereas statements have a word-to-world direction of fit, meaning that the speech-act must conform to the world, imperatives have a world-to-word direction of fit, meaning that the world must conform to the speech-act."

    content: "Suppose that there is a lottery in which 1,000 tickets are sold but only one ticket wins. It is rational regard to any given ticket as a loser. But if one does so, one must irrationally regard all of the tickets as losers. This is not much of a paradox. First of all, given any ticket, it cannot be rationally believed that it will lose, but only that it is more likely than not that it will lose. To be sure, in some contexts, high probabilities are interchangeable with certainties: if one knows that x is 99% likely to occur, then one can 'accept' x's occurrence, in the sense that one will act and within limits even reason as though it will definitely occur."

These schemes never involve putting in time at an office, and one can work one's own hours. Also, theoretically, one can make an unlimited amount of money at one of these schemes doing very little work. But that isn't how it works out. People involved in such schemes end up putting in longer hours than people with real jobs and doing harder work, while being paid little or nothing. The solution to this paradox is that slackers are playing a defensive game."

The less it depends on any given person, the more useless to the economy any given person is and, consequently, the less able any given person is to find a way to earn a living by participating in it. So as economies become more efficient, people become more economically useless and therefore less able to earn a living and more dependent for their livelihood on welfare of some kind. Hence the following paradox: The more efficient an economy is, the more people tend to be prevented from profiting from it."

Knowledge of the past provides no basis for knowledge of the future. Solution: When we know the future, it is on the basis of continuities, not regularities.
